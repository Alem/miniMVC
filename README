### DESCRIPTION ###

miniMVC is a simple MVC framework for PHP - about as simple as you can get. 
It is designed to provide a minimalist, bare-bones base for your own specific 
application/framework and to allow you the freedom to hack your way to the rest. 


### SETUP ####

1. Create the MYSQL database for the application.

2. Define the relevant information in config.php

3. Generate a controller, model and view with generate.php
	ex. ./generate.php --mvc example --table example

4. Use controller by visiting http://localhost/YOURAPP/controller/method/variable
	ex. http://localhost/miniMVC/test/index
	ex. http://localhost/miniMVC/test/add/testentry

5. Hack away.


### CONVENTIONS ###

it is highly recommended to adhere to these conventions.
