<h1> miniMVC Guide </h1>

<h2> Getting Started </h2>
Read the included README.md and ensure the environment requirements are met.

<h2> Controllers </h2>
The controllers serve to manage the logical/logistic tasks such as handling user requests fetching data from relevant sources and processing it appropriately. 
They are equiped with methods to load components (models,modules,views,templates and even other controllers) and inherit this functionality from the frameworks base 'Controller' class. 

The controller recieves the user's request through the url in the form:
site.com/controller/method/variable

A typical controller method would look like this:
<code>
function actionIndex(){
	$this -> view( 'index' );
}
<code>
